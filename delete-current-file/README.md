# Sublime-DeleteCurrentFile

This plugin adds a command (`DeleteCurrentFile: Delete File`) to the command palette which will delete the current file and close the buffer.

With the plugin's settings you may customize if you want to see a confirmation message, or if you want to send the deleted file to the trash or the unrecoverable void.

By default there is no confirmation message and the file is moved to the trash.
